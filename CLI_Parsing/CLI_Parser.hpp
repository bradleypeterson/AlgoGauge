         * number of algorithms passed matches the number of lengths passed, and number of algorithm options passed.
         * Originally, we were using the commented out block to easily do this since the vector object already has a
         * builtin length property. The problem we ran into however, is that we would then have no way of knowing
         * which algorithm option was tied to which algorithm.
         *
         * E.g.
         * If the following args were "--algo quick --len 5 -r --algo selection --len 10 -e --algo merge --len 15 -r"
         * The original way would store the args as follows:
         *      vector<string> algo = {"quick", "selection", "merge"}
         *      vector<string> len = {5, 10, 15}
         *      vector<bool> ran = {true, true}
         *      vector<bool> rep = {true}
         * The algo and len vectors are fine since each algorithm is stored in the order it was listed in the CLI,
         * however, since the algorithm options are all separate bool vectors, there is no way to know if the two
         * true values in the ran vector were for the first 2 algorithms, last 2 algorithms, or ends.
         *
         * One solution to this is to get rid of the separate algorithm option vector<bool> objects and replace it with
         * a single vector<string> object like with the algo vector object. However, I opted against this as it would
         * make the code side more simple, but the CLI side more complicated and more prone to user errors. Since I
         * valued prioritizing simplicity on the CLI side, this is the route I went for.
         *
         * There is no harm in uncommenting out the following lines. The only reason they were commented out to begin
         * with is it's best practice to remove or comment out unused objects.
