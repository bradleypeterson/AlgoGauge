### Hash Tables
---
- [ ] Add Hash Tables
  - [ ] Open hash tables (linked list hash tables)
  - [ ] Closed hash tables (array hash tables)

  - [ ] linear probing vs quadratic probing 
    - [ ] Percentage Limit (capacities that follow a prime / 4 that has a remainder of 3)
    - [ ] if linear probing vs quadratic probing then add 
    - [ ] (options) how full do you want the hash table to be? 10%, 20% 50%, 80%, 90% 91%
    - [ ] insert, delete, look-ups
      - [ ] add, remove, look-up items that only exist                      *at 90%
      - [ ] add, remove, look-up items that could exist or couldn't exist   *at 90%
    - [ ] add load test frequent insertion and deletions
    - [ ] worst case senario for linear, quadriadic probing at diferent levels of hashtable fullness. 
    - [ ] worst probe count or time to complete 
    - [ ] how much values you want to input into hash table (100 - 1 million)?

### Linked Lists
---
- [ ] Add Linked Lists
