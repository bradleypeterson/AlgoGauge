# AlgoGauge Functionality TODO List
---

### Hash Tables
---

  - [ ] Open hash tables (linked list hash tables)
  - [ ] add quadratic probing and other types of probing algorithms.
  - [ ] Percentage Limit (capacities that follow a prime / 4 that has a remainder of 3)
  - [ ] if linear probing vs quadratic probing then add 
  - [ ] worst case senario for linear, quadriadic probing at diferent levels of hashtable fullness. 
  - [ ] worst probe count or time to complete 

### Data Structures
---
- [ ] add doubly linked lists
- [ ] add stacks and queues
- [ ] add trees (b-trees, AVL trees, etc.)
- [ ] add heaps

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

### P1

- [x] Add array, linked list options CRUD operation resize array
- [x] Add Hashing comparisons
- [x] Validate Perf, ways to measure l1 cache. *
- [x] Better documentation

### P2

- [ ] GPU algorithms, CUDA
- [ ] Variations of current sort algorithms (quick sort, merge sort 1...k, selection)
- [x] Javascript and python
- [ ] JAVA and Rust support
- [ ] CPU vectorization algorithms
- [ ] Trees AVL vs B trees
- [ ] Better windows support
- [ ] Better python support maybe see about uploading to pip
  - [ ] Still will use pipx but ideally we would be able to use pipx with the url to github (windows users)

### P3

- [ ] Unit/Perf testing for cpu bound, memory bound, and latency bound.
- [ ] Add Tim sort Algorithm and other sort
- [ ] Optimization mode, O0, O1, O2, O3
- [ ] graph storage mechs
- [ ] Over under prediction betting, make the site fun
- [ ] repeated and chunk slider
- [ ] Parallel processing of algorithms vs Serial.
- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Fix readme
